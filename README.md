Once you go to the Website you'll be Welcomed by our Intro Screen where you have the Option to either Login or Register.  When you Press Register it will take you to our Registration page that is fairly self-explanatory.  Fill in a Username and Password and click Register; once you've done that it will securely save it to our database and encrypt your password.  Then, it'll redirect you to the Login page, once you login you'll be able to see everyone's public wits.  From there, you'll be able to type in anything you want and send it out for the world to see!
